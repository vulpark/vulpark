# vulpark
A vulpine gathering.

This is HEAVILY work in progress

Needs MongoDB installed locally and on port 27017 (default)

Don't ask for help I don't know how any of this works

## outline
- ~~fake users~~
- ~~send messages from user to user~~
- ~~store messages in database~~
- ~~access sent messages from endpoint~~
- ~~users in database~~
- ~~create channels~~
- ~~attach messages to channels~~
- ~~set up GitHub login / account creation~~
  - GUI should probably start being written around here too (WIP!!)
- create guilds <-------- we are here
- attach channels to either a guild or a user
- more login types maybe
