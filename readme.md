That's just the working title atm.

This is HEAVILY work in progress

Needs MongoDB installed locally and on port 27017 (default)

Don't ask for help I don't know how any of this works

## outline
- ~~fake users~~
- ~~send messages from user to user~~
- ~~store messages in database~~
- ~~access sent messages from endpoint~~
- ~~users in database~~
- create channels <-------- we are here
- attach messages to channels
- set up GitHub login / account creation
  - GUI should probably start being written around here too
- create guilds
- attach channels to either a guild or a user
- more login types maybe
